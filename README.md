# StalkingYourGf

##Project created on GitHub's hackhathon at AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow. 

Main goal was to guess (select person which is most likely to be) girlfriend/boyfriend of selected user. 
Boyfriend/Girlfriend was chosen according to data published by all friends of that person.
**In 10 hours** we managed to create simple facebook scrapper and some data collection solutions to feed our AI.
Few things needs to be done to make this project work:
- Scrap a lot of FB data.
- Create good AI algorithm
- Feed AI with data
